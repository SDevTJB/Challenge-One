## Description
I have been tasked with refactoring and improving code provided to me by Horiseon Marketing Agency. My main goal is to ensure their website meets current accessibility standards. Accessbility within webpages is a very important element of web development as this ensures everyone can use websites as they are intended to be used. This is espcially crucial for individuals with vision impairment, for example, as acessbible code will allow programs such as screen readers to work properly and efficiently. 

The following changes have also been implemented: 
    - Reabability has improved: Code now follows a distinct order, allowing future developers to better navigate the code should they need to. This is important as it will save future developers time if they need to make any considerable changes 
    - ALT tags have been given to images. In cases of screen readers, or poor connection issues, the ALT text will either display or be read out to the user. This will ensure that no one is missing out on any content of the webpage.
    - Semantic Elements have now been introduced within the HTML document. This comes hand in hand with the readability also introduced. This will allow developers to know exactly what a particular section of code does. Most dividing elements have been removed and replaced accordingly when applicable.
    - Classes within CSS have also been edited and altered. Previously, there were many classes which could have been condensed into one reference. The code now follows a logical sequence and matches the order of the HTML document.
